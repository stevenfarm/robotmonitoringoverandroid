This is the read me file for the robotermonitor app.

Problem was: During a task (e.g. milling) a roboter arm/joint will be put into minimal oscillation.
Plan was: Measure the oscillation with a sensor and show the data on an app.

What you need: Bosch XDK Sensor or Arduino/Raspberry with sensors and Wlan attached.

Task of the app is to download data as a client from a server.

To get it running:
1) Download the file and unzip it 
2) Install Android Studio
3) Open new Project and choose "robotmonitoroverandroid"
4) Fix the link in the code where the app downloads your data
5) Debug it
6) Start the Android Emulator or let it run on your android smartphone

Any questions? Feel free to ask.
